# Frank's List
This is an online store meant for buying and selling used goods throughout the BOW (Babson, Olin, Wellesley) community.  
  
This web app is built using flask, firebase, and Jinja.
Run web.py to view our website locally. Make sure flask and firebase admin sdk are installed. A key is needed to access the firebase database.  

Our goal is to make it easier for BOW students to exchange items. This will reduce physical and digital (email) waste.  
 
To build on this project, you can add functionality through the .py files and update the page displays in the templates folder.
